    "\n",
    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is a structured collection of data that allows for storage, retrieval, and management of information. Databases can be managed through Database Management Systems (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases**:\n",
    "- **Schema-based**: SQL databases use structured schemas to define data and relationships.\n",
    "- **Relational**: Data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for transaction management.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases**:\n",
    "- **Schema-less**: NoSQL databases can store unstructured data without a fixed schema.\n",
    "- **Non-relational**: Data can be stored as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling and large-scale data distribution.\n",
    "- **Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language)** is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CREATE**: Used to create a new table or database.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      Name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "      Age INT\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **DROP**: Used to delete an existing table or database.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DROP TABLE Students;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **ALTER**: Used to modify an existing database object, such as a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN Address VARCHAR(255);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE**: Used to delete all records from a table without removing the table itself.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  TRUNCATE TABLE Students;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is a set of SQL commands used to manipulate data within tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INSERT**: Adds new records to a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 23);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records in a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  UPDATE Students SET Age = 24 WHERE StudentID = 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Removes records from a table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQL (Data Query Language)** is used to query and retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record in a table. Ensures that no two rows have the same primary key value.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      Name VARCHAR(100)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. Establishes a relationship between tables.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Enrollments (\n",
    "      EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      StudentID INT,\n",
    "      CourseID INT,\n",
    "      FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establishing connection\n",
    "conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host='localhost',\n",
    "    user='your_username',\n",
    "    password='your_password',\n",
    "    database='your_database'\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a cursor object\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Executing a query\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM Students\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching results\n",
    "results = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "for row in results:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cursor()**: The cursor() method creates a cursor object which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "- **execute()**: The execute() method executes the given SQL query using the cursor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: Specifies the table to query data from.\n",
    "2. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on a condition.\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows sharing a property.\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on a condition.\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: Specifies which columns to retrieve.\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY**: Orders the result set.\n",
    "7. **LIMIT**: Limits the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n"
